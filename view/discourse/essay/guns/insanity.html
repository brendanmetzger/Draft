  <p class="intro">Gun nonsense number 1</p>
  <p>It's pretty fucked up that the mentally ill are not allowed to have guns. Why are they automatically dangerous? Or don't have the right to protect themselvesZ</p>
  <p>What about "sane" stupid angry people? I have less problems with schizophrenia than someone supposedly _not insane_ thinking the earth is 5000 years old. Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p>Forgive me for my insensitivity, but isn't everything that comes out of Michelle Bachmanns mouth legitimate paranoia? Isn't paranoia a type of mental illness. <strong>Take her fucking guns!</strong></p>
  <p>If you're paranoid that the government is going to take your guns away, then you for sure should have your guns taken away.</p>
