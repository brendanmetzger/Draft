  <p>Regarding degrees (and I include both bachelor's and master's), design education is not something I have been able to convince myself is done that well—at least as it concerns making someone a better at making things, which is probably the most needlessly reductionist definition of design I can provide. </p>

  <p>My pedigree, educationally, is not straightforward or impressive. I have enrolled in 6 undergraduate colleges, and attended courses regularly over a timeline that spanned about a decade. I continued taking undergraduate courses at a few other colleges after graduating, but never amassed more than a single degree—and this does not matter to the point I want to convey—though I've amassed over 180 credit hours which is approximately the amount of hours a graduate student might attain. My credits don't count for for much because I didn't pursue anything specific. The point here worth talking about is <em>pursuit of what</em>.</p>

  <p>My undergraduate degree-seeking self led me to classes within the degree requirements, but after graduation, I bubbled with a concern that my occupation was mostly enforced with skills that I was picking up using a stagnating version of trial-and-error.  Suffice it to say, when I was on a track, I worried about the track, and I wanted the track to tell me I was doing well. That's another way of saying I avoided anything too rigorous or absent from my strengths. After graduation there was no track, I didn't care about grades or progress, so I started taking classes (read: difficult subjects) that I had avoided and came to find that I appreciated this setup much more. </p>

  <p>Outcome is something the conscious mind will fixate on, but it is a suspicious endeavor, muddled in pretense. That is not a conclusion I have come through learning and observation, rather, this is something I feel in my gut after one-third of my life spent trying to make things professionally. I have taught college-level courses as an adjunct, and in dealing with that epiphany I  gained in my experience as a learner, I would  pose the following question to my students at some point in the semester,  "Would you rather do good work for a C, or absolute shit work for an A?"</p>

  <p>I don't fault the near unanimity that students, if not begrudgingly, admitted a preference for the latter, because the truth is, we live in an world concerned by status, even if we are shown when it it is a complete veneer. But design is simply, I daresay, a way of <em>working thoughtfully</em>—a considered process that is revised continually. Skills become very powerful tools for someone that engages with design, and the more obscure, wide, and varied they are, the  more profound the potential for meaningful work becomes.</p>

  <p>It took me a lot of observation in my career to learn that outcomes are almost always the same in the end, but how someone travels that path and the skills they implement along the way to navigate are better the more varied they become.</p>
  
  <p>It took me a long time to come to terms with calling myself a designer, and I've only done so after realizing it's a perspective, not an occupation. For instance, let us imagine the organic farmer that organizes and schedules and delivers a product that adheres to, and holds a deep concern for humanity. To deliver that product, the farmer regularly employs a trove of useful skills and must often be creative in the face of budgets and circumstance and mission to deliver something wholesome without cutting corners. An occupation that requires devising, making and fixing things almost constantly. What is someone who devises, makes, and fixes called when you have fancy glasses, and should it still be called the same thing if the practitioner cannot make a proper weld when necessary?</p>

  <p>Juxtapose that with my typical experience with people who—and I won't belabor this point because it is nearly cliché—call themselves 'designers'. The vast majority are vain and selfish in many aspects of their work, and have the nerve to write <q>culture</q> and <q>branding</q> adjacent to one another. This is frustrating not because those are shitty traits, but because they actually went to school, ostensibly, to learn how to do things better.</p>

  <p>[1] I learned by bouncing around the chicago schools system, that often adjuncts teach at several institutions. The same accredited course which can be taught by the same instructor at two different schools. It seems, the only difference is what the student pays, which can be extreme.</p>
