  <p>This pile of scripts will help structure ideas, and then hopefully evaporate into something better (or worse).</p>
  <p>Key to ensuring that we tease ourselves with new possibilities, my practice often involves spending a fair amount of time ironing out the usual problems in the initial stages and then see how clever I can get at the end. If the ironing is too sloppy in the beginning then expression begins to suffer as the efforts continue. This frameworks represents some of the things I have learned over the years.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the only thing worse than hampered creativity is no creativity, and I think this is what most frameworks offer as features. While I don't mean to insult practioners of any method, but you can't do something awesome if you can't do something simpleâ€”even if its a little unconventional or dangerous.</p>
  <p>This set of files and patterns is the most basic starting point I think I'm comfortable sharing after a decade of <q>working for the internet</q>. A full disclaimer: <strong>some of my strategies are odd, definitely frustrating if your brain is not my brain.</strong>  I simply want to share them because there might be something interesting in the deep, and I actually do want people to start making their own projects again.</p>
  <p>Below is a list of some of my takeaways from my career.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't handle anything sensitive</li>
    <li>Dependencies should be met with the same reaction as a flatulated elevator (Avoid, if unavoidable, make a stinky fug face)</li>
    <li>Think hard about how data is managed (especially RDBMS and mapping/models/patterns)</li>
    <li>Never get the <q>easy</q> things wrong (markup)</li>
    <li>Write very little program code (an entire application need not excede ~1000 <acronym>SLOC</acronym>)</li>
  </ul>
