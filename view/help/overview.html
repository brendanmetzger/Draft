    <h2>Policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't handle anything sensitive</li>
      <li>Dependencies should be met with the same reaction as a flatulated elevator (Avoid, if unavoidable, make a stinky fug face)</li>
      <li>Think hard about how data is managed (especially RDBMS and mapping/models/patterns)</li>
      <li>Never get the <q>easy</q> things wrong (markup)</li>
      <li>Write very little program code (an entire application need not excede ~1000 <acronym>SLOC</acronym>)</li>
    </ul>
