# Draft

An austere way to develop websites

## Principles
- Caching is easy, and it's a crutch. This framework is designed to operate un-cached
- Complete and non-negotiable separation of data/models and views
- Minimalist
- Perfect execution of DOM and non-negotiably valid markup
- no component of the application will exceed 100 lines, and no more than 10 components (max 1000 SLOC)
